# Azure_Data_Pipeline_for_COVID_Analytics

## Project Overview

This project is designed to provide comprehensive insights into Covid19 data through a streamlined data processing and visualization pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, Azure SQL Database, and Microsoft Power BI.

### Data Ingestion from Diverse Sources:
   - Utilize Azure Data Factory's versatile Link Services to seamlessly ingest data from various sources, including HTTP URL services, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2), and Azure Blob Storage.

### Orchestrated Data Movement:
   - Efficiently orchestrate end-to-end data pipelines, orchestrating the movement of data from source to Azure Data Factory, incorporating robust link services for smooth and reliable data flow.

### Data Processing with Azure Data Factory:
   - Leverage Azure Data Factory's powerful data processing capabilities to transform and cleanse the data, ensuring accuracy and consistency in preparation for downstream analysis.

### Ingestion into Azure SQL Database:
   - Employ Azure Data Factory pipelines to ingest processed data into Azure SQL Server, facilitating storage and accessibility for further analysis.

### Visualization in Power BI:
   - Enable insightful Covid19 analytics through seamless integration with Power BI, creating compelling dashboards to visualize key metrics such as covid cases and death counts.
